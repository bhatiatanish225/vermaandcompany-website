# Pricing and Shipping Changes Summary

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Removed 18% GST from Displayed Prices**
All product prices now show the base price without GST by dividing the database price by 1.18:

**Files Updated:**
- `src/pages/Home.tsx` - Product cards in hero section
- `src/pages/Shop.tsx` - Product grid and list views
- `src/pages/Cart.tsx` - Individual item prices and subtotal
- `src/pages/Checkout.tsx` - Order summary
- `src/components/ProductCard.tsx` - Product card component
- `src/context/CartContext.tsx` - Cart calculations

**Formula Used:** `Math.round(product.price / 1.18)`

### 2. **Updated Shipping Information**
Changed from "FREE" shipping to indicate shipping costs are extra:

**Before:**
- Cart: "FREE"
- Checkout: "Free"

**After:**
- Cart: "Extra as per delivery"
- Checkout: "Extra as per delivery partner"

**Added Note:**
"* Shipping costs will be calculated based on delivery partner and items being delivered"

### 3. **Removed Tax Calculations**
- Removed 18% tax calculations from Cart and Checkout
- Updated totals to reflect GST-free pricing
- Simplified order summaries

## Price Display Examples:

**Before (with GST):**
- Database Price: ₹1,180
- Displayed: ₹1,180 + 18% tax = ₹1,392

**After (without GST):**
- Database Price: ₹1,180
- Displayed: ₹1,000 (₹1,180 ÷ 1.18)
- Shipping: Extra as per delivery partner

## Benefits:
1. **Cleaner Pricing** - Customers see the base price without tax confusion
2. **Transparent Shipping** - Clear indication that shipping costs are separate
3. **Flexible Delivery** - Allows for different shipping rates based on delivery partners
4. **Simplified Checkout** - No complex tax calculations in the UI

## Technical Implementation:
- All price calculations now use `Math.round(price / 1.18)` to remove GST
- Cart context updated to handle GST-free totals
- Shipping information updated across all relevant pages
- Consistent pricing display throughout the application
